	<p class="gry">about the title: Morphology of the Folktale</p>
	<p class="txt"><font class="txtb">Morphology:</font> the study of the form, shape and structure of something.</p>
	<p class="txt">The <font class="txtb">Folktale</font> is somewhat
misleading as it covers a much broader range of material than Propp is
classifying. This is an error of the translators as Propp clearly
defines the set of tales he's working with at the beginning of chapter
2.</p>
	<p class="txt">Propp also dislikes the term "fairy tale" as it only
applies to a subset of tales he examined, but he uses it for lack of a
better convient term.</p>
	<p class="gry">Propp's theses</p>
	<ol class="txt" type="1">
		<li>Functions are constant elements in a tale, independent of how or by whom they are enacted.</li>
		<li>The number of functions within the folktale is limited.</li>
		<li>The sequence of functions in a folktale is constant.</li>
		<li>All folktales are of a type in their structure.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="txt"><font class="txtb">Function:</font> An action of a character, defined from the point of view of its significance for the plot.</p>
	<ul class="txt">
		<li>The folktale at its core preserves traces of very ancient paganism, customs and rituals.</li>
		<li>The folktale is very similar in morphology to the more archaic myths.</li>
		<li>The uncorrupted folktale structure is particuliar to peasants with minimal contact with civilization.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="gry">about the folktale</p>
	<p class="txt">The identifying features of the folktale are it's:</p>
	<ul class="txt">
		<li>fantastic</li>
		<li>told at night</li>
		<li>pleasurable; they have good endings</li>
		<li>about setting things right</li>
		<li>NOT REAL, BUT TRUE</li>
		<li>about characters whose names are generic or descriptive</li>
	</ul>
