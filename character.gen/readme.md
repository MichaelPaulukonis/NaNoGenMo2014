# Character generation
* Going to play around with things.
* Something that will fit in my templated Propp model.
* able to pick masculine/femine
* store relations to other characters/things
* getting close to semantic networks, but probably dumber, to fit in with time-frame, my level of need, and my level of knowledge.
* functions, so can call out to other functions -- say, protaganist() checks if masculine/femine, gets a name. relationship to a parent, mother/father depending upon need.
* some sort of state, so we know if dead or has a posession
* description
* this may not just be characters -- could be things, to. Which have much of the above.
* siblings, for instance. protaganist can say goodbye to each, greet each upon return (Assuming all are alive). sib can have own stories
* character who is a story-teller, and adds a recursive propp-story in the bargain
 * NOTE: I do not think I want the entire text to be nested stories. That's too much of a gimmick. And hard to humanly parse.


## pre-existing characters
See Darius Kazemi's [alt universe prompts](https://github.com/dariusk/ao3/blob/master/index.js) for how it pulls characters from http://archiveofourown.org.
That could be some interesting frisson....

## dialogue
See the novel-generators that snarfed down twitter last year.

* [tweets used as chapter titles](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/4)
* Shestweete [pulls multiple tweets from same person](https://github.com/juhana/shakestweete/blob/master/shakestweete.js) which could be good for a character. But not nesc so.
* Contraculto's [Then I will](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/70) - [source](https://github.com/Contraculto/then-i-will)
* [twitter dialogue plus whatever](https://github.com/dariusk/dialogue) in Darius novel


# Entities
* that is, things, not people
* so similar, but does not have "relations", do they?
 * .... possibly?
* if that's the only difference, it could be just about the same thing
