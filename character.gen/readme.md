# Character generation
* Going to play around with things.
* Something that will fit in my templated Propp model.
* able to pick masculine/femine
* store relations to other characters/things
* getting close to semantic networks, but probably dumber, to fit in with time-frame, my level of need, and my level of knowledge.
* functions, so can call out to other functions -- say, protaganist() checks if masculine/femine, gets a name. relationship to a parent, mother/father depending upon need.
* some sort of state, so we know if dead or has a posession
* description
* this may not just be characters -- could be things, to. Which have much of the above.
* siblings, for instance. protaganist can say goodbye to each, greet each upon return (Assuming all are alive). sib can have own stories
* character who is a story-teller, and adds a recursive propp-story in the bargain
 * NOTE: I do not think I want the entire text to be nested stories. That's too much of a gimmick. And hard to humanly parse.

# Entities
* that is, things, not people
* so similar, but does not have "relations", do they?
 * .... possibly?
* if that's the only difference, it could be just about the same thing
